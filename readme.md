# MERN Stack Developer API

This is a boilerplate project for building an API using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. The project is set up with basic functionality and can be used as a starting point for building more complex APIs.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, you should have the following installed on your machine:
-  Node.js (v10 or later)
-  MongoDB

## Getting Started

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
`git clone https://github.com/<username>/<repository-name>.git`
2. Install dependencies.
`cd <repository-name>` 
`npm install`
3. Set up your environment variables. Copy the .env.example file to .env and update the values as needed.
`cp .env.example .env
`
4. Start the server.
`npm start`

The API will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
## API Endpoints
The following endpoints are available:

- `GET /api/users` - Get a list of all users.
